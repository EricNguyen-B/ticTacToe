## description

This Tic-Tac-Toe program is created using HTML, CSS, & Javascript. With the addition of CSS, I've also referenced to the Bootstrap framework for additional styling. The Tic-Tac-Toe program is mainly comprised of a Bootstrap jumbotron with a restart button and a tic-tac-toe game-grid created with HTML tables. I used Javascript to create the logic to be able to fill in the game-grid with X's and O's as well as allowing the user to clear the game-grid by clicking on the restart button provided.

#### Technologies
